# Admin Login Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
Admin login was failing with credentials `admin@insurance.com/Admin@123`, returning "unauthorized" error.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Email Mismatch**: Flyway migration created admin user with email `admin@thaiinsurance.com` instead of expected `admin@insurance.com`
2. **Password Hash Issue**: The BCrypt hash in Flyway migration (`$2a$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2uheWG/igi.`) was incorrect and didn't match any standard passwords
3. **DataInitializer Conflict**: DataInitializer was attempting to create users that already existed from Flyway migration, causing database constraint violations

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Admin Credentials**: Updated existing admin user to use correct email (`admin@insurance.com`) and password (`Admin@123`)
2. **Resolved DataInitializer**: Modified to check for existing users before attempting creation
3. **Verified Authentication**: Used comprehensive debugging to confirm all authentication steps work correctly

## Final Working Credentials

### Primary Users (Recommended)
- **Admin**: `admin@insurance.com` / `Admin@123`
- **Agent**: `agent@insurance.com` / `agent123` 
- **Customer**: `customer@insurance.com` / `customer123`

### Legacy Users (From Flyway Migration)
- **Admin**: `admin@thaiinsurance.com` / `password123` *(broken hash - not working)*
- **Agent**: `agent1@thaiinsurance.com` / `password123` *(broken hash - not working)*
- **Adjuster**: `adjuster1@thaiinsurance.com` / `password123` *(broken hash - not working)*
- **Customer**: `customer1@email.com` / `password123` *(broken hash - not working)*

## Technical Details
- **Authentication System**: Working correctly (JWT + Spring Security)
- **Password Encoding**: BCrypt with proper salt
- **User Roles**: RBAC implemented with `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_AGENT`, `ROLE_CUSTOMER`
- **Database**: H2 in-memory with Flyway migrations + DataInitializer

## Files Modified
1. `DataInitializer.java` - Fixed to avoid user creation conflicts
2. `SecurityConfig.java` - Temporarily allowed debug endpoints (later removed)
3. `README.md` - Updated with correct login credentials
4. Temporary debug controllers (created and removed during troubleshooting)

## Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ User exists check
2. ✅ Password hash validation
3. ✅ UserDetails service loading
4. ✅ Authentication manager validation
5. ✅ JWT token generation (if using auth endpoint)

## Status: **RESOLVED** ✅
Admin login is now fully functional with credentials `admin@insurance.com/Admin@123`.
